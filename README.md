# Social Network API

## Description

For this assignment I created a NOSQL application that runs offline. This application has the ability to create users, thoughts, reactions, and add friends. All of this functionality is show in the walkthrough video where Insomnia is used to show how the user can look up users, individual users, create new users, update users, and delte them. The same functionality exists for thoughts. Reactions and friends can be created or deleted. The data created can be seen in the MongoDB Compass.

To run the application, he user will run the command 'node index.js' in the command line to start the server. This can be seen in the first walkthrough video.
